Bachelor's degree in History and Master's degree in International Relations, formerly worked at the United Nations and the Right Livelihood Award Foundation.

My journey into coding all started with a free course offered by Stanford University at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. I stumbled around trying to make Karel the robot stop spinning endlessly across my screen, as I figured out how loops worked. 
  
I was instantly hooked. I loved how much there was to learn. All the different rabbit holes to go down. The freedom to create anything. So I continued studying, learning new languages, creating programs, slowly making them more and more complex. I'd be lying if I didn't at times spend hours frustrated and unable to fix a bug which ended up just being a missnamed variable or a missing bracket. But, I knew that I was truly passionate about programming and therefore it was something I should pursue as a career rather than just as a hobby.
  
Currently looking for a role where I can continue to learn and expand my programming knowledge.

# Skills 
 
  #### Critical thinking  

My Bachelor's degree in History and Master's degree in International Relations taught me to think critically. This skill has been transferred and improved during my programming studies. I have learnt not simply to be satisfied by the easiest or first solution to solving a problem, I always question if there is a better solution or whether mine can be improved upon.
  
 #### Teamwork 

Having been both a leader and member of various teams, has taught me how to effectively communicate, collaborate, organize and support others in a team environment. Maker's Academy's focus on daily Pair Programming and group projects has also taught not only how to transfer these skills into the world of programming, but also how to work efficiently with a variety of different personalities.
  
 #### Languages  

_Fluent in English, French, Italian and highly competent in Spanish_

My ability to learn and speak multiple languages has translated in my programming. Paired with a learning mindset that always looks for improvement, it has created the foundation for me to easily pick up new languages and tools.
